  <h3> THE IMPORTANCE OF GETTING REGISTERED TO VOTE </h3>
 <p> <img src="IMG_20231027_195525.png" alt="IMG_20231027_195525" width="20%"/></p>
 <p> The Bill of Rights in South Africa’s pioneering Constitution grants all citizens aged 18 and older the right to vote, but the question often asked is whether voting will really make a difference.
Of course it does! Voting gives you an opportunity to be part of decision-making that affects your life and the future of our country. If you don't vote, others will make the decisions for you.
History shows that democracies in danger of losing their freedom register frighteningly low voter turnouts. In thriving democracies, people vote in large numbers and the people's voice remains supreme.<p/>

<p><h4>So here are our top reasons why you should vote:</h4></p>

<p>1. Because you can!
You may take your right to vote and all other rights in our constitution for granted, but 25 years ago most of the people in our country were not allowed to vote. Many of them were arrested and jailed for demanding this most basic human right. Others were tortured and killed. Because of their sacrifice, today you can vote simply by presenting yourself at a voting station with your ID during a registration event that puts you on the voters' roll for life, and lets you vote in every future general and by-election in your area.</p><br/>
<p>2. Elections have consequences
You have the power to decide on the quality of life you want for yourself and your community, and even future generations. Voting is your chance to stand up for the issues you care about. This is your life: take the time to help decide what's best. Voting - rather than just venting on social media or protesting – is the best way to make your voice heard and make a positive input on the issues that concern you.</p><br/>
<p>3. It's your money
You pay taxes (even when you just buy a loaf of bread), but do you know how that money is being spent? Most people don't. Voting is your chance to choose how your taxes are spent – such as funding for social services, healthcare and schooling.</p><br/>
<p>4. Voting is an opportunity for change
If you're thinking that right now you've got better things to do with your time and you'll vote next time, think again! Five years is a long time to be stuck with something that you don't want or doesn't work. Just imagine what it would be like to be stuck with the same cellphone for five years, especially one with limited features. Just think how many cellphone upgrades you are going to get before you get the chance to upgrade your government!<p/><br/>
<p>5 Our generation knows best
Technology and connectivity means that our generation is probably the best informed and equipped to vote in South Africa's history. Social media and the internet is giving us access to information which previous generations of voters didn't have. You are becoming the experts ahead of your parents and grandparents. Use that expertise to make sure our country heads in the right direction!</p><br/>
<h3> HOW TO GET REGISTERED </h3>
<img src="vote.jfif" alt="vote.jfif" width=20%" align="left"/>
<p>You must:
  <ul>
  <li>be a South African citizen;</li>
  <li>be at least 16 years old (you can only vote from age 18);</li>
  <li>have a green, bar-coded ID book; smartcard ID; or valid Temporary Identity Certificate (TIC).</li>
  </ul><p/>
  <p>With our busy lives these days with work or other responsibilities we do not always have the time to go to the IEC to actually get registered to vote. We may also live far from the IEC and may not have the resources to get registered in person so we have create a way to get registered online.

 <h1 align="center" font="Arial MT"><u>YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT</u></h1>

<h3> Youth Unemployment Rate in South Africa</h3>

<p> As we head deeper into 2023, the issue of youth unemployment remains a significant concern if Stats SA’s latest Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS) is anything to go by.</p>
<p>South Africa’s young population is severely affected by unemployment and remains disengaged from the labour market.</p>
<p><h3>Youth unemployment by gender</h3></p>

<p>In terms of gender, the men in this age group experienced a decrease in the NEET rate by 2.3 percentage points.

Unfortunately, women in this age group saw an increase of 0.6 of percentage point.

It’s noteworthy that the NEET rate for women was higher than that of their male counterparts in both years.</p>
<p>In a larger group of those between the ages of 15 and 34, the number of NEET individuals decreased by 1.6 percentage points, from 46.3% during the same period in 2022 to 44.7% in 2023.

To put things into context, the official unemployment rate for the first quarter of this year was 32.9%, as per the Labour Force Survey (QLFS).</p>

<h2 align="center"> Solution To Youth Unemployment </h2>

<p>1. Education and training programmes

Initiatives or extracurricular instruction that target the skills gap can focus on anything from employability skills to job hunting and interviewing to entrepreneurship to vocational education (including opportunities in the green economy). Ideally, in the future, these kinds of education will be embedded into national curricula, tackling the skills gap.
Examples of training programmes include our Work the Change initiative and Be the Change Academies, which provide young people with the skills they need to succeed in their careers.</p>
<p>2. Youth access to capital

For young people keen to get start-ups funded, they don’t have to rely on banks alone. Crowdfunding sites like Kiva.org and networks like Youth Business International give young people all over the world the chance to get the support they need to build their enterprises and increase their incomes. With more programmes like these being created every day, the future is getting brighter for aspiring entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>3. Universal internet 

With programmes like Facebook’s Internet.org working towards free internet access to key sites and Computer Aid providing IT education across 32 countries, this solution to the digital divide is coming along. However, infrastructure development (electrical grids, etc.) is obviously key to this goal. As lower-income nations develop these sectors, the digital divide will continue to be bridged.</p>

<p><h2> Sites to help youth acces oppertunities for employment </h2></p>

<p>There are different sites that youth can use which can help them access oppertunities at employment. These are some of the Sites:

<h2>Bursary oppertunities for the youth </h2>
